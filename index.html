					<p class="wysiwyg__paragraph js-viewport-transition">Ben Goulet-Scott, a Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences' Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) and a fellow in the Arboretum's Hopkins Lab, and Jacob Suissa, OEB Ph.D. candidate in the Friedman Lab at the Arboretum, hope their research in the Mamoní Valley Preserve in Panama will increase our understanding of how biodiversity can persevere in the face of climate change, deforestation, and human disturbance.</p>
					<p class="wysiwyg__paragraph js-viewport-transition">The 20-square-mile land conservancy on the isthmus separating Central and South America teems with life, <a class="wysiwyg__link js-viewport-transition" href="#">making the condensed rainforest habitat a perfect location for their research project because of the vast number of known and potentially undiscovered species living there</a>, Goulet-Scott said.</p>

					<p class="wysiwyg__paragraph js-viewport-transition">"New England has twice the land area of Panama, but half the number of bird species, and 10 times fewer reptiles and amphibians,” he said. “This particular location contains species that migrate or move from north to south and get funneled into this very narrow area, concentrating an incredible amount of biodiversity."</p>
					<p class="wysiwyg__paragraph js-viewport-transition"><a class="wysiwyg__link js-viewport-transition" href="#">The Mamoní Valley Preserve (MVP) Natural History Project</a> is an ongoing series of student-led field expeditions, organized by Goulet-Scott in 2017. The project is designed to establish a baseline understanding of how the different land-use conditions within the preserve — from fully deforested cattle pasture to recovering secondary forest and intact primary forest — affect patterns of diversity.</p>
					<p class="wysiwyg__paragraph js-viewport-transition">By bringing early career biologists like himself to the site for fieldwork, Goulet-Scott is building a list of species and observations to eventually make available in a central repository for scientists and researchers focused on conservation.</p>
